          "question": "What are some reasons why Ebay would refuse to Close My Account?",
          "answer": "Ebay will not close your account if you have any unpaid fees, if your account balance is not zero, if you have unresolved suspensions, if you have restrictions and if you have any open bids. ",

          "question": "Can I Reactivate a Deleted Account?",
          "answer": "If you change your mind during the time it takes to close your account, you can contact Ebay and ask to have it reopened.  After the 30-day or 60-day period (depending on whether you've bought or sold in the past 30 days) your account will be permanently closed. If you'd like to use eBay again, you'll need to create a new account.  However, you won’t be able to create a new one under the same ID or email address ever again.",

          "question": "Can I Close My Account if I recently bought or sold an item on Ebay?",
          "answer": "Yes, but the process will be delayed. If you've bought or sold items in the 30 days prior to submitting your request, Ebay will keep your account open for 60 days from receiving your request so any outstanding sales or purchases can be completed, and so Ebay can meet their commitments to all buyers and sellers under the eBay Money Back Guarantee.",
