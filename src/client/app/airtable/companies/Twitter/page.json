All you have to do is log back in.  If it's past 30 days then the answer is no.  Your data will be gone and you cannot reactivate. ",

You can, however,  make your username or email address open for reuse before deactivating your account. To do this, you must first change the content in your profile and then confirm the change prior to deactivation.",
